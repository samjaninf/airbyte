# Granola

<HideInUI>

This page contains the setup guide and reference information for the [Granola](https://www.granola.ai/) source connector. Granola is an AI-powered meeting notes tool. This connector reads meeting notes from a Granola workspace using the [Granola Enterprise API](https://docs.granola.ai/introduction).

</HideInUI>

## Prerequisites

- A Granola workspace on the Enterprise plan
- A Granola API key (generated by a workspace administrator)

## Setup guide

### Generate an API key

1. Log in to your Granola workspace as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Workspaces**.
3. Select the **API** tab.
4. Click **Generate API Key**.
5. Copy the generated API key and store it securely.

### Set up the Granola connector in Airbyte

1. Enter a **Name** for the Granola source connector.
2. Enter your **API Key**.
3. (Optional) Enter a **Start Date** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. The connector replicates notes created on or after this date. If you leave this field empty, the connector defaults to replicating notes from the last two years.
4. Click **Set up source** and wait for the connection test to complete.

## Supported sync modes

The Granola source connector supports the following sync modes:

| Feature                        | Supported? |
| :----------------------------- | :--------- |
| Full Refresh Sync              | Yes        |
| Full Refresh Sync - Overwrite  | Yes        |
| Incremental Sync               | Yes        |
| Incremental Sync - Append      | Yes        |

## Supported streams

The Granola source connector supports the following stream:

| Stream  | Sync mode   | Primary key |
| :------ | :---------- | :---------- |
| `notes` | Incremental | `id`        |

### Notes

The `notes` stream retrieves meeting notes from your Granola workspace using the `GET /v1/notes` endpoint. Each record includes the note ID, title, object type, owner (name and email), and creation timestamp.

The Granola Enterprise API only provides access to notes that have been shared in workspace-wide folders. Private notes are not accessible through the API. For more information, refer to the [Granola Enterprise API documentation](https://docs.granola.ai/help-center/sharing/integrations/enterprise-api).

This connector does not use the single-note detail endpoint, so fields available only on that endpoint (such as summaries, transcripts, attendees, calendar events, and folder membership) are not included.

## Performance considerations

The Granola API enforces rate limits per workspace:

| Metric         | Value                             |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Burst capacity | 25 requests                       |
| Time window    | 5 seconds                         |
| Sustained rate | 5 requests per second (300/minute) |

The connector handles rate limiting automatically by retrying requests when a `429 Too Many Requests` response is received.
