This page contains the setup guide and reference information for the [Granola](https://www.granola.ai/) source connector.

</HideInUI>

## Prerequisites

- A Granola workspace on the Enterprise plan
- A Granola API key (generated by a workspace administrator)

## Setup guide

### Generate an API key

1. Log in to your Granola workspace as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Workspaces**.
3. Select the **API** tab.
4. Click **Generate API Key**.
5. Copy the generated API key and store it securely.

### Set up the Granola connector in Airbyte

1. Enter a **Name** for the Granola source connector.
2. Enter your **API Key**.
3. Enter a **Start Date** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. The connector replicates notes created on or after this date.
4. Click **Set up source** and wait for the connection test to complete.

## Supported sync modes

The Granola source connector supports the following sync modes:

| Feature                        | Supported? |
| :----------------------------- | :--------- |
| Full Refresh Sync              | Yes        |
| Full Refresh Sync - Overwrite  | Yes        |
| Incremental Sync               | Yes        |
| Incremental Sync - Append      | Yes        |

## Supported streams

The Granola source connector supports the following stream:

| Stream  | Sync mode   | Primary key |
| :------ | :---------- | :---------- |
| `notes` | Incremental | `id`        |

### Notes

The `notes` stream retrieves meeting notes from your Granola workspace. Each record includes:

- Note ID and title
- Owner name and email
- Creation timestamp

API keys provide read access to publicly accessible notes within your workspace, including notes shared in workspace-wide folders.

## Performance considerations

The Granola API enforces rate limits per workspace:

| Metric         | Value                             |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Burst capacity | 25 requests                       |
| Time window    | 5 seconds                         |
| Sustained rate | 5 requests per second (300/minute) |

The connector handles rate limiting automatically by retrying requests when a `429 Too Many Requests` response is received.
