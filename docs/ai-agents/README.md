# Agent Engine

Airbyte's Agent Engine is a data layer for AI agents. Use the Agent Engine as a cloud platform to manage connectors, credentials, and data replication for your agents. You can also use Airbyte's open source agent connectors as standalone Python packages, import them into your AI agents, and manage storage and credentials yourself.

:::info New and growing
The Agent engine is new and growing. Airbyte is actively seeking feedback. Expect this platform and its library of connectors to grow and change rapidly.
