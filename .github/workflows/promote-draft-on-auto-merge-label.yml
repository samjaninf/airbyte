name: Promote Draft on Auto-Merge Label

# This workflow automatically marks draft PRs as ready for review
# when an auto-merge label is added. This complements the
# enforce-draft-pr-status workflow: if a PR is converted to draft
# before its auto-merge label is applied, this workflow will
# promote it back to ready once the label arrives.
